## Executive Summary

This week marks a major evolutionary milestone: the **Silver Tier Evolution** is now 100% operational. The system has shifted from static rule-based scripts to a **local AI Brain (Ollama)**. We successfully tested the end-to-end pipeline: Perception -> Reasoning -> Outreach -> Sync.

**Key Highlights**:
- ✅ **Ollama Integrated**: local `llama3.2:3b-small` now powering all plans and drafts.
- ✅ **Multi-Account Gmail Sync**: Synchronized drafts for `tahiryamin52`, `2050`, and `2030`.
- ✅ **Automated Scheduling**: All 4 background loops are now active in Windows Task Scheduler.
- ✅ **Smart Filter Refinement**: "Inquiry-First" logic now correctly ignores marketing/noise.

### Recent Success
